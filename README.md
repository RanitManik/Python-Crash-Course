# Acknowledgments

I express my gratitude to the Python community and the extensive array of resources that have played a pivotal role in fostering my development as a Python programmer. In particular, I want to extend a special thanks to Harish sir (CodeWithHarry) for his exceptional course, which comprehensively addresses all fundamental and crucial aspects of Python programming.
Special thanks to:

- Online tutorials and courses that provided valuable insights and knowledge about Python programming.
- Stack Overflow and other developer forums where I found solutions to challenging coding problems.
- Open-source Python projects and repositories that inspired and educated me in various aspects of Python development.
- My friends and fellow programmers who offered support, feedback, and encouragement throughout my Python coding
  journey.

Thank you for joining me on this magical adventure through Python-Crash Course. Together, we can harness the power of Python
and weave wonders through code!
