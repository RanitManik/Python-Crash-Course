""" The difference between plus and comma in a print statement in Python is that
 the plus sign will concatenate the strings together,
 while the comma will print the strings separated by a space.
 For example, the following code will print the two strings "Hello" and "World" on separate lines:"""

print("Hello")
print("World")

# The following code will print the two strings "Hello" and "World" on the same line, with a space in between:

print("Hello", "World")

# The following code will print the two strings "Hello" and "World" on the same line, with no space in between:

print("Hello" + "World")

# The comma can also be used to print multiple values of different types.
# For example, the following code will print the number 1, the string "two", and the boolean value True:

print(1, "two", True)

# The plus sign cannot be used to print multiple values of different types.
